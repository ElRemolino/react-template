# React-Template

# Motivation
## Setting up React with Webpack and Babel was something I struggled to understand when I first learned about React. I wanted to set up a template in order to learn more about how to configure Webpack and Babel

# Build Status
## Template is complete. Planning on creating a seperate repo for a MERN template

# Installation
## - Fork and clone this repo to your local machine
## - Run npm install to set up your enviornment
## - Run npm run Webpack to build and combile bundle
## - Run npm start to set up Webpack Server
