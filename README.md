# React-Template

# Motivation
Setting up React with Webpack and Babel was something I struggled to understand when I first learned about React. I wanted to set up a template in order to learn more about how to configure Webpack and Babel

# Build Status
Template is complete. Planning on creating a seperate repo for a MERN template

# Installation
1. Fork and clone this repo to your local machine
2. Run `npm install` to set up your enviornment
3. Run `npm run Webpack` to build and combile bundle
4. Run `npm start` to set up Webpack Server
